Huddled in the leftmost corner of my homeroom, under the teacher’s desk, my classmates whisper. The windows are shut, the door locked, there isn’t a single gap for any light to wander in. My homeroom teacher watches us silently and looks at her watch—it serves as a small solace that this is only a drill. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lockdown drills have become as common as fire drills. Sophomore Nadia Walker says, “You’ve got to prepare for a shooting in a place where you’re supposed to be learning, feeling safe. It’s just not right.” Walker adds, “My main problem is machine guns and AK-47s—there’s no justification for why it should be in civilian hands.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mass shootings that make headlines are no longer surprises, just stark reminders of the societal issues that plague our country. As of 2021, there have been </span><a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">166 mass shootings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">white supremacist groups were responsible for</span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/us/domestic-terrorist-groups.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two-thirds</span> </a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of “terrorist plots and attacks” in the first eight months of 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These violent acts of domestic terrorism are the result of many root causes: the easy access to weapons, the hate-filled rhetoric in the media, the deep-rooted insecurity and ignorance of white supremacists, and the lack of adequate treatment for people suffering from severe mental health issues. These violent attacks are not isolated incidences, and they are not a consequence of isolated causes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some states have become part of the solution. On January 16, 2013, New York became the first US state to act after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by passing the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act. This act required universal background checks for all firearm purchases while expanding definitions of assault weapons and creating a state database for handguns. New York also banned the sale or purchase of magazines that could hold more than seven rounds of ammunition. As a result, New York now has the third-lowest gun death rate. However, not every state is taking the same actions as New York to implement gun reform. In fact, 21 US states still have extremely lenient gun safety laws, such as open carry laws, meaning that someone can openly carry a firearm in public. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State-to-state variability in gun safety laws has created a system in which almost half of all US states have lax gun control laws. “Federal action is a necessity,” comments Walker. To tackle the gun violence epidemic, Biden is rolling out a series of new measures. First, he will curb the spread of firearms called “ghost guns,” which are homemade guns assembled with parts purchased online. These guns do not have a traceable serial number and therefore are not subject to background checks. The second major law he plans to implement will allow family members or law enforcement to petition for a court order to temporarily bar an individual from purchasing a firearm. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nadia Walker believes, “Biden’s legislation will have an impact, but for the change that most people want, it won’t really help.” One of the most effective ways to reduce gun violence is a universal background check, such as the one in Switzerland. Like the US, Switzerland has a strong gun culture; however, its homicide rate is three times less than that of the US. Switzerland’s application process for a gun license is rigorous and includes stringent background checks; a single gun is issued with a license that is only valid for 8-9 months. Moreover, automatic weapons are banned in Switzerland. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, universal background checks are not required by federal law. In fact, less than half of US states have adopted this into the process of purchasing a firearm. According to a Gallup poll in 2018, 92% of people surveyed were in favor of universal background checks, 64% of whom were Republicans, and 67% of which were gun owners. So what’s stopping Congress from implementing universal background checks?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has halted crucial gun reform legislation that would significantly damage their business. The NRA’s supporters are gun manufacturers who want to retain their revenue. During the 2016 election, the NRA spent $54 million on lobbying for less gun legislation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NRA has also deployed disinformation campaigns to secure control over public discourse. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gun lobbyists twist the narrative by pretending to care about human rights when in fact they are motivated by profit. Nothing should stand above an individual’s right to live. No one should have to put their life on the line every time they go to school, work, or the grocery store. Gun reform in the United States requires decisive action; it requires a government that is willing to hold the gun industry accountable for its actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can you do as a student activist?</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participate in demonstrations led by March For Our Lives and other student organizations. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact your local and national representatives.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educate yourself about the filibuster.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*March For Our Lives is organized and founded by students who survived the shooting at Marjory Douglas High School. They have three main demands: ban assault weapons, restrict the amount of gun ammunition, and close loopholes in background checks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*The filibuster is a way for one or more senators to delay a bill from being brought to vote by extending the debate, often by discussing an issue for an excessive amount of time. This tactic is a barrier to passing many policies; it has been used for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the Equality Act, the $15 minimum wage, gun safety reform, prescription drug reform, immigration reform, and more.</span></p>\n"), excerpt: RenderHTML(rendered: "<p>Photo courtesy of Justin Levy Yi Lin Lang Opinions Reporter The lights go out.
